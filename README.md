# Codeigniter Server Side Google charts

**This module has been developed to allow users to display graphs based on data in database tables, using an MVC pattern, based on Codeigniter. Given that the user's data is in the correct format, he/she will be able to display that data onto Google's charts.**

**Although not entirely as dynamic as one would want, the module nonetheless allows the user to implement it for multiple charts, with ease - changing only a few lines of code to suit the purpose.**

*N.B. - The chart response has been prepared using the options and code displayed on the Google charts developer page. Although the response pattern may change for different charts, the basic layout remains the same.*
